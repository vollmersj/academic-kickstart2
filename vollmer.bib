                   describes work carried out in partnership with Homeless
                   Link, a UK-based charity, in developing a data-driven
                   approach to assess the quality of incoming alerts from
                   members of the public aimed at connecting people sleeping
                   rough on the streets with outreach service providers. Alerts
                   are prioritised based on the predicted likelihood of
                   successfully connecting with the rough sleeper, helping to
                   address capacity limitations and to quickly, effectively,
                   and equitably process all of the alerts that they receive.
                   Initial evaluation concludes that our approach increases the
                   rate at which rough sleepers are found following a referral
                   by at least 15\% based on labelled data, implying a greater
                   overall increase when the alerts with unknown outcomes are
                   considered, and suggesting the benefit in a trial taking
                   place over a longer period to assess the models in practice.
                   The discussion and modelling process is done with careful
                   considerations of ethics, transparency and explainability
                   due to the sensitive nature of the data in this context and

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTMany Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques currently
               available rely on discrete-time reversible Markov processes
               whose transition kernels are variations of the
               Metropolis?Hastings algorithm. We explore and generalize an
               alternative scheme recently introduced in the physics literature
               (Peters and de With 2012) where the target distribution is
               explored using a continuous-time nonreversible
               piecewise-deterministic Markov process. In the
               Metropolis?Hastings algorithm, a trial move to a region of lower
               target density, equivalently of higher ?energy,? than the
               current state can be rejected with positive probability. In this
               alternative approach, a particle moves along straight lines
               around the space and, when facing a high energy barrier, it is
               not rejected but its path is modified by bouncing against this
               barrier. By reformulating this algorithm using inhomogeneous
               Poisson processes, we exploit standard sampling techniques to
               simulate exactly this Markov process in a wide range of
               scenarios of interest. Additionally, when the target
               distribution is given by a product of factors dependent only on
               subsets of the state variables, such as the posterior
               distribution associated with a probabilistic graphical model,
               this method can be modified to take advantage of this structure
               by allowing computationally cheaper ?local? bounces, which only
               involve the state variables associated with a factor, while the
               other state variables keep on evolving. In this context, by
               leveraging techniques from chemical kinetics, we propose several
               computationally efficient implementations. Experimentally, this
               new class of Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes compares favorably
               to state-of-the-art methods on various Bayesian inference tasks,
               including for high-dimensional models and large datasets.

  abstract  = "The computational complexity of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
               methods for the exploration of complex probability measures is a
               challenging and important problem in both statistics and the
               applied sciences. A challenge of particular importance arises in
               Bayesian inverse problems where the target distribution may be
               supported on an infinite-dimensional state space. In practice
               this involves the approximation of the infinite-dimensional
               target measure defined on sequences of spaces of increasing
               dimension bearing the risk of an increase of the computational
               error. Previous results have established dimension-independent
               bounds on the Monte Carlo error of MCMC sampling for Gaussian
               prior measures. We extend these results by providing a simple
               recipe for also obtaining these bounds in the case of
               non-Gaussian prior measures and by studying the design of
               proposal chains for the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with
               dimension-independent performance. This study is motivated by an
               elliptic inverse problem with non-Gaussian prior that arises in
               groundwater flow. We explicitly construct an efficient
               Metropolis--Hastings proposal based on local proposals in this
               case, and we provide numerical evidence supporting the theory.",
