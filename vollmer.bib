                   most disadvantaged people in modern society. This paper
                   describes work carried out in partnership with Homeless
                   Link, a UK-based charity, in developing a data-driven
                   approach to assess the quality of incoming alerts from
                   members of the public aimed at connecting people sleeping
                   rough on the streets with outreach service providers. Alerts
                   are prioritised based on the predicted likelihood of
                   successfully connecting with the rough sleeper, helping to
                   address capacity limitations and to quickly, effectively,
                   and equitably process all of the alerts that they receive.
                   Initial evaluation concludes that our approach increases the
                   rate at which rough sleepers are found following a referral
                   by at least 15\% based on labelled data, implying a greater
                   overall increase when the alerts with unknown outcomes are
                   considered, and suggesting the benefit in a trial taking
                   place over a longer period to assess the models in practice.
                   The discussion and modelling process is done with careful
                   considerations of ethics, transparency and explainability
                   due to the sensitive nature of the data in this context and
                   the vulnerability of the people that are affected.",
