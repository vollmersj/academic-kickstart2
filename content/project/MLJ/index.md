MLJ (Machine Learning in Julia)  is a toolbox written in Julia that provides a common interface and meta-algorithms
for selecting, tuning, evaluating, composing and comparing machine model implementations written in Julia and other
languages. More broadly, the MLJ project hopes to bring cohesion and focus to a number of emerging and existing, but
previously disconnected, machine learning algorithms and tools of high quality, written in Julia. A welcome corollary
of this activity will be increased cohesion and synergy within the talent-rich communities developing these tools.
In addition to other novelties outlined below, MLJ aims to provide first-in-class model composition capabilities. Guiding
goals of the MLJ project have been usability, interoperability, extensibility, code transparency, and reproducibility.
