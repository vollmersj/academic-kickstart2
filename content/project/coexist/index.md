title: Modelling COVID-19 exit strategies for policy makers in the United Kingdom
summary: The potential of using less accurate tests as means of pandemic surveillance is missed, rather than providing reliable medical information about an individual. We investigate whether the additional information from non-diagnostic-quality mass testing can lead to the implementation of a quicker and lower risk exit strategy from lockdown.
