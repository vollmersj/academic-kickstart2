 abstract = {As the size of engineered systems grows, problems in reliability
theory can become computationally challenging, often due to the
combinatorial growth in the number of cut sets. In this paper we
demonstrate how Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) --- a simulation
approach which is typically used for stochastic differential
equation models --- can be applied in reliability problems by
carefully controlling the bias-variance tradeoff in
approximating large system behaviour. In this first exposition
of MLMC methods in reliability problems we address the canonical
problem of estimating the expectation of a functional of system
lifetime for non-repairable and repairable components,
demonstrating the computational advantages compared to classical
Monte Carlo methods. The difference in computational complexity
can be orders of magnitude for very large or complicated system
structures, or where the desired precision is lower.},
