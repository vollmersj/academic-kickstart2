 abstract = {ABSTRACTMany Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques currently
available rely on discrete-time reversible Markov processes
whose transition kernels are variations of the
Metropolis?Hastings algorithm. We explore and generalize an
alternative scheme recently introduced in the physics literature
(Peters and de With 2012) where the target distribution is
explored using a continuous-time nonreversible
piecewise-deterministic Markov process. In the
Metropolis?Hastings algorithm, a trial move to a region of lower
target density, equivalently of higher ?energy,? than the
current state can be rejected with positive probability. In this
alternative approach, a particle moves along straight lines
around the space and, when facing a high energy barrier, it is
not rejected but its path is modified by bouncing against this
barrier. By reformulating this algorithm using inhomogeneous
Poisson processes, we exploit standard sampling techniques to
simulate exactly this Markov process in a wide range of
scenarios of interest. Additionally, when the target
distribution is given by a product of factors dependent only on
subsets of the state variables, such as the posterior
distribution associated with a probabilistic graphical model,
this method can be modified to take advantage of this structure
by allowing computationally cheaper ?local? bounces, which only
involve the state variables associated with a factor, while the
other state variables keep on evolving. In this context, by
leveraging techniques from chemical kinetics, we propose several
computationally efficient implementations. Experimentally, this
new class of Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes compares favorably
to state-of-the-art methods on various Bayesian inference tasks,
including for high-dimensional models and large datasets.
