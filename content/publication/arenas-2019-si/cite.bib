 abstract = {We present a policy and process framework for secure
environments for productive data science research projects
at scale, by combining prevailing data security threat and
risk profiles into five sensitivity tiers, and, at each
tier, specifying recommended policies for data
classification, data ingress, software ingress, data egress,
user access, user device control, and analysis environments.
By presenting design patterns for security choices for each
tier, and using software defined infrastructure so that a
different, independent, secure research environment can be
instantiated for each project appropriate to its
classification, we hope to maximise researcher productivity
and minimise risk, allowing research organisations to
operate with confidence.},
