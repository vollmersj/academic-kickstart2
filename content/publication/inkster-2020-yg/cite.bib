 abstract = {During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, digital
technologies have become a major route for accessing remote care.
Therefore, the need to ensure that these tools are safe and
effective has never been greater. We raise five calls to action
to ensure the safety, availability, and long-term sustainability
of these technologies: (1) due diligence: remove harmful health
apps from app stores; (2) data insights: use relevant health data
insights from high-quality digital tools to inform the greater
response to COVID-19; (3) freely available resources: make
high-quality digital health tools available without charge, where
possible, and for as long as possible, especially to those who
are most vulnerable; (4) digital transitioning: transform
conventional offline mental health services to make them
digitally available; and (5) population self-management:
encourage governments and insurers to work with developers to
look at how digital health management could be subsidized or
funded. We believe this should be carried out at the population
level, rather than at a prescription level.},
