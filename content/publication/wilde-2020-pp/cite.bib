 abstract = {Rough sleeping is a chronic problem faced by some of the
most disadvantaged people in modern society. This paper
describes work carried out in partnership with Homeless
Link, a UK-based charity, in developing a data-driven
approach to assess the quality of incoming alerts from
members of the public aimed at connecting people sleeping
rough on the streets with outreach service providers. Alerts
are prioritised based on the predicted likelihood of
successfully connecting with the rough sleeper, helping to
address capacity limitations and to quickly, effectively,
and equitably process all of the alerts that they receive.
Initial evaluation concludes that our approach increases the
rate at which rough sleepers are found following a referral
by at least 15% based on labelled data, implying a greater
overall increase when the alerts with unknown outcomes are
considered, and suggesting the benefit in a trial taking
place over a longer period to assess the models in practice.
The discussion and modelling process is done with careful
considerations of ethics, transparency and explainability
due to the sensitive nature of the data in this context and
the vulnerability of the people that are affected.},
