 abstract = {The computational complexity of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
methods for the exploration of complex probability measures is a
challenging and important problem in both statistics and the
applied sciences. A challenge of particular importance arises in
Bayesian inverse problems where the target distribution may be
supported on an infinite-dimensional state space. In practice
this involves the approximation of the infinite-dimensional
target measure defined on sequences of spaces of increasing
dimension bearing the risk of an increase of the computational
error. Previous results have established dimension-independent
bounds on the Monte Carlo error of MCMC sampling for Gaussian
prior measures. We extend these results by providing a simple
recipe for also obtaining these bounds in the case of
non-Gaussian prior measures and by studying the design of
proposal chains for the Metropolis--Hastings algorithm with
dimension-independent performance. This study is motivated by an
elliptic inverse problem with non-Gaussian prior that arises in
groundwater flow. We explicitly construct an efficient
Metropolis--Hastings proposal based on local proposals in this
case, and we provide numerical evidence supporting the theory.},
